					<p class="h6">	The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The World Happiness 2017, which ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels, was released at the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness on March 20th. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations.</p>

					<p class="h6">The happiness scores and ranking use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors –</p><p class="lead"> economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity</p><p class="h6"> – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors.

					The data set has data for the year 2015, 2016 & 2017.</p>

					A database like above is a fantastic opportunity to get some philosophical insight into the question "What is happiness?". Everyone strives to be happy but now not only do we have the data on which citizens of a country feel better we also have the metrics on what they think makes their life better. Not only do we get to know which country fares better in terms of happiness, but also understand in which factors like economy, freedom, generosity, life expectancy, social support, etc. 
					<br>
					<br>
					When it comes to happiness a common question found amongst people is "Does money make a man happy?". Since with money a person can afford more amenities, resources, etc. he should be able to have a better lifestyle than others thus it stands to reason that countries with better economy should have a higher happiness score than poor economy. This leads to our First question..</h6>

					<p>You do not need a keen eye to observe that countries that rank higher in GDP(the green/dark green boxes) cover the top-left part of the chart which in tree-map charts is also the part with boxes with higher areas(high happiness score). As we keep moving to the bottom right side of the chart the color keeps turning to yellow indicating a decrease in GDP with the area of the boxes decreasing simultaneously.</p>

But since citizens of every country on an average would have a family it seems to reason that contribution of happiness from the family should be constant throughout the globe.

					<h3>No, We see that family contribution to happiness follows the happiness trend of countries.</h3>
					<p>Although the scatterplot shows a good amount of variance, it is not hard to pick out that countries with lower happiness score report lower family contribution to happiness and it increases with the increase in happiness score. The trend line directly gives a proportional increase in family contribution to happiness with increase in happiness.</p>

					<h6 class="display-6">It seems that both money and family are a good indicator and contributor of happiness of the citizens of a country. But if these statistics are to be used to make the citizens of the country happy i would wonder where would i put in the most effort so that my country is happy. As a Government body should i better the economy?, should i provide better health services?, should i invest in citizen welfare programs that increase their generosity amongst their own people? or should i bring better laws and rules that increase the public's trust toward the government? Fortunately we have them as factors of happiness in database to determine which factor would be the most significant. </h6>

					<h3>Line chart allows us to compare different factors with respect to increasing happiness score thus we can see the contribution of each factor for the country's happiness score.</h3>
					<p>By having different factors on different slots of x-axis, we can compare the average of each factor w.r.t. Avg Happiness Score. The more the slope for the graph the more a factor contributes to overall happiness. We see that Generosity contributes the most in overall happiness whereas Economy contributes the least with the order being Economy < Health < Family < Freedom < Trust < Generosity.  </p>

					<h5 class="display-5">
						World Happiness Report is a simplistic but effective report where columns like GDP per capita, Family, Life Expectancy, Generosity, Trust describe the extent to which these factors contribute in evaluating the happiness of each country. On first thought it seems that every factor must be a major contributor to the happiness of a nation. But during our visualization process we see that there are many outliers and considering the count of nations is 155 (small number), the trend lines are heavily influenced by outliers and huge variance. Even so with a small dataset we are able to obtain critical observations on how countries are affected via Economy(GDP per capita). We can understand how generosity and trust in govt of the nation gets a top priority when dealing with happiness. We can also say that the claim of being rich makes you happy might not be exactly true or insignificant when compared to other factors like the health of an individual.
